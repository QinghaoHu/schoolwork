Topics start here:
	Reactivity trends on periodic table:
		Theory:
			For the metals: Lossing	
				when the number of protons increase, the attraction between the protons in the nucleus and the valence shell electrons increase, 
				it is getting harder to lose electrons. Decrease
				Hard to lose. 
				
				When the electrons are further away from electrons, the strength between nucleus and the valence shells decrease. 
				Easty to lose. 
				
			For the non-metals: gaining
				when the number of protons increase 
				the attraction between the protons in the nucleus and the valence shell electrons increase. 
				Easy to gain electrons, increase. 
				
				When the electrons are further away from electrons, the strength between nucleus and the valence shells decrease.				
				It's harder to gain electrons from others. 
				hard to gain electrons, decrease. 
				
			Alkali metals can not put in the water:
				Alkali metal is extremely easy to lose electrons, it will create hydrogen gas with water, causing explosion. 
				
				
	Chemical property or physical property:
		Physical property:
			Observed with senses
			Determined without destroying matter:
				eg. color, density, solubility(dissolves), sour taste, melting point, hardness, boiling point, luster, odor and conductivity
				
		Chemical property:
			reacts with air, reacts with acid, flammability, support combustion 
			
			
		Physical changes:
			a change in size, state and shape
			no new substance formed:
				eg. change of states, changes of shapes. 
				
				
				
				
				
		chemcail changes:		
					dissolves in water
					silver tranishes
					baking soda reacts to vintger
					fe rusts
					milk sours
					wood rots 
					food is digested
					dish washer reacts with water. 
					Hard to reverse
					rusts
					
					
					
		Ionic compounds and molecular compounds:
			Ionic:
				High conductivity with metal
				high melting points
				solubility, can be dessolve by water
				shape: crystalline
				
			Molecular:
				Low conductivity non-metals
				low melting point
				solubilty in water, sometimes
				shape: crystalline or amorphous 
				
				
				ionic has charge
				
				molecular share electrons.
